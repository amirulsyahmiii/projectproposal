# Problem Statement: 
Our goal is to create an IoT system that monitors and controls the temperature and humidity levels in a greenhouse. The system will collect real-time data from sensors placed inside the greenhouse and use it to make informed decisions about when to activate a water sprinkler or turn on a fan to adjust the temperature and humidity levels. The main objective is to create a sustainable and efficient environment for plant growth, resulting in increased yield and reduced energy consumption.
